NAME
	syscall sendbt() - timed blocking send	


SYNOPSIS
	#include <xinu.h>
	syscall sendbt(pid32,umsg32,int);	


DESCRIPTION
	sendbt() works similarly to send(), but has an addiional argument which allows for timed blocking.The additional argument, maxwait, is of type int32 and specifies how long a process may block before it returns. If its value is 0, then sendbt() becomes a blocking send() that may wait indefinitely. If its value is negative, an error should be returned.If the receiver's 1-word message buffer is empty, sendbt() behaves as send(). If the receiver's buffer is full, however, sendbt() blocks, i.e., the kernel context switches out the calling process and puts it into a waiting state, call it SENDING.If maxwait > 0, then the sending process is inserted in the sleep queue to be woken up after maxwait time (in unit of millisecond). When the receiver buffer eventually clears and the blocked process succeeds in sending a message before the maxwait sleep expires, the process must be removed from the sleep queue.


OPTIONS
	no options, since it isn't command line
